# General stuff

## Clash of Wills

Contested roll between characters. Roll `Gnosis + Arcanum`. Other supernatural beings of pools specified in their rules. Ties reroll - someone must have more successes than the other(s).

Whoever wins get their effect to resolve; all others fail. This does not usually mean that other effects are cancelled.

Mages are always aware of Clashes with their spells, and can spend Willpower in their rolls. Spells with Advanced Potency get +1 to the roll. Day-long spells get +1, weeklong get +2,
month-long get +3, and longer get +4.

## Casting Durating Combat

Remember that normally, spells must be at touch range. Taking more than 1 round to cast a spell means the Mage still applies their Defense against attacks but cannot make other combat
actions until complete (unless a rule allows it).

Casting while grappled applies a -3 to spellcasting if the Mage failed the grapple check that turn. The Mage cannot use any Yantras that require movement, but Yantras involve prior to
the grapple still take effect.

## Spell Stacking

Spells that grant the same effect do not stack; the highest effect is used.

## Spell Controll

Post casting, the Mage generally cannot modify the spell without cancelling & recasting. As an instant action, a Mage can reduce a factor of the spell in any way so long as it's still
applied equally across targets in the area. Cancelling a spell is a reflexive action.

A Mage can have a number of active spells equal to their Gnosis for free; additional spells each 1 Reach plus 1 Reach for the number of active spells over their free limit.

A Mage can relinquish a spell without cancelling, allowing maintaining more active spells, by spending 1 Willpower. At the beginning of each Chapter, the Storyyeller rolls 1 die
per Reach used in the spell above their free limit (minimum 1 Chance die) and ...

- Dramatic failure: spell continues _and_ skips the roll next Chapter
- Failure: spell continues
- Success: the Storyteller applies a Reach like that from Paradox on the spell
- Exceptional Success: the spell ends

This is generally illegal in most Consilia.

A Mage can spend a whole Willpower dot to continue the spell, without Storyteller rolls, until its Duration ends.
